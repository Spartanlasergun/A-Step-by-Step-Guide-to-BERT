# A Simple Guide To BERT

This repository contains a simple guide to using the BERT model for text classification. This guide has been created with the intention of making machine learning a bit more accessible to the average user. There are a few pre-requistes. You must understand programming in python at the object level, and you must have some familiarity with statistics.

It is very difficult to avoid touching on advanced topics in statistics and taking other concepts for granted - where this is unavoidable, I have tried to provide some theoretical understanding that will at least serve to intrigue the user and perhaps help him/her cultivate a bit of appreciation for the machine learning paradigm in general.

The google collaboratory notebook - 'A_Simple_Guide_To_BERT.ipynb' - gives a complete step by step walkthrough of loading data, doing the preprocessing, intializing the bert model, generating the embeddings and performing text classification using logistic regression.
