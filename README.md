# A Step by Step Guide To BERT

This repository contains a simple guide to using the BERT model for text classification. This guide has been created with the intention of making machine learning a bit more accessible to the average user. There are a few pre-requistes. You must understand programming in python at the object level, and you must have some familiarity with statistics. Even without this, I have kept the guide simple enough that most beginnner programmers will still be able to make a lot of headway with using the BERT model. 

It is very difficult to avoid touching on advanced topics in statistics and taking other concepts for granted. In particular I have avoided going into detail on explanations of logistic regression which would be extremely complex even for the advanced user.

The google collaboratory notebook - 'A_Step_by_Step_Guide_To_BERT.ipynb' - gives a complete step by step walkthrough of:
* loading data
* doing the preprocessing
* intializing the bert model
* generating the embeddings
* and, performing text classification using logistic regression.
