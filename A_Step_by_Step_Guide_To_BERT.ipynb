        "The layout of this guide is very simple. It is meant to be read from top to bottom - i.e. step by step. It's also better if you work directly in google collaboratory rather than reading the notebook from github.\n",
        "\n",
        "The theoretical understanding that is necessary for using BERT is given in markdown cells that typically appear before or after the relevant blocks of code. To simplify things even further, this guide uses external modules sparingly - and these external modules are only imported in the cells where they are used to avoid confusing the reader concerning which module is in use for a specific task. Regular python array are used where possible instead of dataframes as most people may find it much more comfortable to stick with the basics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of programming and statistics, though it is my hope that even without this, most of the necessary understanding will still be imparted.\n",

        "# A Brief Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "What is machine learning really? What are we doing here? What are we trying to accomplish when we say that we wish to **classify** a bit of text? Well, it's no different than classifying something in real life. We live in world of many things - apples, oranges, trees, flowers, birds, fishes etc. None of these are the same. When we classify text, the goal is to identify specific attributes or gain insights about its nature. For example, we might seek to determine whether the text conveys a positive or negative sentiment, assess its grammatical correctness, or categorize it as poetry, a narrative essay, a speech, or another form of communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's easy enough to read and understand a piece of text as a human being, but if we were to give this text as input to a computer, how then would it understand - how then would it be able to **classify**? What logical procedure can the machine apply to understand in the same way as a human being?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of BERT (or text classifiation in general), this means taking large archives of text data from places like wikipedia and identifying meaningful representations of words, phrases and sentences that can be used to produce meaningful **mathematical representations** of any given set of words, phrases or sentences. This mathematical **model** can the be used to determine if a given set of text data is more similar to text that is happy, sad, angry, a poem, a tweet, musical lyrics etc. Theoretically, there are no limits to the categories we can assign.\n",
        "\n",
        "So how do we take a word in the english language and represent it mathematically? Or, how do we take a sentence and do the same?\n",
        "\n",
        "Cosider the word **'The'**. Lets assign a number to this word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let the word **'The'** be represented by the integer **1234**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we've done this, there's nothing to stop us from assigning unique numbers to all of the words in the english language. In fact, lets take things a step further. Consider the sentence:\n",
        "\n",
        "**The sky is blue.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Assuming that we have some dictionary containing unique integer values for each word/symbol in the english language, we can assign unique numbers to each word/symbol in this sentence such that:\n",
        "\n",
        "**The --> 1234**\n",
        "\n",
        "**sky --> 435**\n",
        "\n",
        "**is --> 2389**\n",
        "\n",
        "**blue --> 678**\n",
        "\n",
        "**. --> 390**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we have technically represented this sentence mathematically with the list of numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$[1234, 435, 2389, 678, 390]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This is good, but its not yet quite enough. Truthfully, we have very barely captured anything at all - in fact, all we've done is convert the sentence into a list of numbers. To actually capture the meaning in a sentence means considering the actual content of each word, the positions of each word in relation to all the others, the context of the sentence itself and all of the words that constitute it, along with many other factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no natural law that guides the process of capturing this meaning, but rather it is the culmination of years of rigorous testing that has resulted in the production of models like **BERT** that can do the job for us. As you shall soon see, our simple list of numbers will become transformed into a very complex vector that is typically hundreds of units long - but very accurate as a mathematical representation of a sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vectors that **BERT** produces are typically of the length 768 or 1024, but there are smaller models ranging from 128 to 512 units. Since we want to conserve processing we will be using one of the smaller models. You can picture the vectors that BERT produces as a list of long rational numbers that have no discernible meaning at a glance, i.e.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$[3.3432532, -4.56462222, 7.4535535345, -4.54654646, ...]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, there is little that needs to understand about how these vectors are produced mathematically. In this introductory guide, I will take you through the process of loading some text data; preparing it for processing with **BERT**; generating the vectors that represent our text; and finally, using these vectors to do some simple text classification."

What you need to understand, is that BERT is a transformer itself and the many layers of processing that is done by the BERT transformer to generate our vector representation of text is not readily accesible to the average user.

Fortunately, it is not necessary to understand it as we have python modules that can easily do the job for us.
